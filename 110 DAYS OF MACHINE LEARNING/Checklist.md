## Welcome to the 110 Days of Machine Learning Challenge! 

Join the [community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/I79mmIBMFC8H94hfdr1bgX) for support.

- You can either fork this repo or click this Google doc [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OI8wjBEIFagR5HJMQ51wtvkHZyErsMSCdQsdON8mQqo/edit?usp=sharing) to have your own checklist. 
- Make sure you store all your projects and findings in a GitHub repository
- Always celebrate your milestones and publicize your works
- You can skip topics you already have firm knowledge about 

Also, note this challenge is supposed to be for 22 weeks. That’s giving an allowance of 2 days weekly for rest and unwinding. 
Please try to observe the rest you need as you take on this challenge. All the best!

## FOR CONTRIBUTORS
- You can provide links to resources for learning (please indicate if the resources are free or paid and if they provide certificates or not)
- You can add new things to learn (that aren't in the checklist) under the 'BONUS' Days
